## 📋 Quick Start (Testnet Deployment)

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Foundry
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
cd multihook-adapter
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your PRIVATE_KEY and SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

### 2. Deploy Factory System
```bash
# Easy deployment
./scripts/deploy-testnet.sh

# Or using Makefile
make deploy-factory NETWORK=sepolia

# Or manual deployment
forge script scripts/DeployFactory.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --broadcast
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
```bash
forge script scripts/VerifyDeployment.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The production system consists of:

1. **MultiHookAdapterFactory** - Main coordinator (creates sub-factories internally)
2. **BasicAdapterFactory** - Deploys immutable adapters  
3. **PermissionedAdapterFactory** - Deploys governance-controlled adapters
4. **AdapterDeploymentHelper** - High-level deployment workflows

## 💡 Key Features

### Advanced Fee Calculation System
- **8 fee calculation strategies**: Weighted Average, Mean, Median, First/Last Override, Min/Max Fee, Governance Only
- User-selectable methods per pool
- Pool-specific fee overrides
- Governance fee management

### Flexible Deployment Options
- **Immutable Adapters**: Fixed hook sets for stability
- **Permissioned Adapters**: Dynamic hook management with governance
- **CREATE2 Deterministic Deployment**: Predictable addresses
- **Batch Deployment**: Multiple adapters in one transaction

### Production-Grade Security
- Role-based access control (Governance, Hook Manager)
- Hook approval registry for permissioned adapters
- Comprehensive validation and error handling
- Reentrancy protection

## 📊 Gas Cost Analysis

| Operation | Gas Cost | USD (20 gwei, $2000 ETH) |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------|
| Factory System Deployment | ~2.0M gas | ~$80 |
| Basic Adapter Deployment | ~1.2M gas | ~$48 |
| Permissioned Adapter | ~1.5M gas | ~$60 |

## 🔧 Available Commands

### Makefile Commands
```bash
make install           # Install dependencies
make build            # Build all contracts  
make test             # Run all tests
make deploy-factory   # Deploy factory system
make deploy-all       # Deploy everything
make verify           # Verify deployment
make status          # Show deployment status
```

### Script Commands
```bash
./scripts/deploy-testnet.sh    # Complete testnet deployment
forge script scripts/DeployFactory.s.sol --broadcast
forge script scripts/DeployBasicAdapter.s.sol --broadcast  
forge script scripts/DeployPermissionedAdapter.s.sol --broadcast
```

## 🛡️ Security & Best Practices

### Deployment Security
- Private key management guidelines
- Multi-signature setup for governance
- Contract verification on Etherscan
- Address validation procedures

### Operational Security  
- Role separation (Governance vs Hook Manager)
- Hook approval process for permissioned adapters
- Emergency procedures documentation
- Comprehensive access controls

## 📈 Next Steps

### Testnet Phase
1. ✅ Deploy factory system to Sepolia
2. ✅ Verify all contracts on Etherscan
3. 🔄 Deploy example adapters
